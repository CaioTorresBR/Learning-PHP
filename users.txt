    # our database will automatically handle every id, incrementing the number when we add a new user
    
    username VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL, # if the user tries to declare more than 30 characaters, it will be cut
    pwd VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, # passwords tend to be bigger in length, due to security reasons
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, # emails tend to be bigger as well
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIME, # CURRENT_TIME will assign the current time in the server, in case this value is not previousy assigned
    
    PRIMARY KEY (id) # Primary key is basically a way to define which column inside this table that has to be unique
